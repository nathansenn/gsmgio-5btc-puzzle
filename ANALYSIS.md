## SalPhaselon Phase (Partially Solved)

### How to Access
SHA256(`GSMGIO5BTCPUZZLECHALLENGE1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe`) = `89727c598b9cd1cf8873f27cb7057f050645ddb6a7a157a110239ac0152f6a32`

URL: `gsmg.io/89727c598b9cd1cf8873f27cb7057f050645ddb6a7a157a110239ac0152f6a32`

### Decoded Elements

#### Binary (abba) Sections
Using `a=0, b=1`:
1. `matrixsumlist` - suggests calculating matrix sum
2. `enter` - possibly indicates newline or submission

#### Number-to-Letter Encoding
Using `a=1, b=2, ... i=9, o=0`, then converting to base 16 (hex) to ASCII:
1. `174161018595377387932283725836301293648834223172419022725145445` → `lastwordsbeforearchichoice`
2. `36026487402470099740341006948` → `thispassword`

#### Text Hints
- `sha b e f our first hint is your last command` - indicates SHA256 encryption, with first hint being the final key
- `shabefanstoo` - possibly "SHA256 answer too" or similar

### Unsolved AES Blob
```
U2FsdGVkX186tYU0hVJBXXUnBUO7C0+X4KUWnWkCvoZSxbRD3wNsGWVHefvdrd9z
QvX0t8v3jPB4okpspxebRi6sE1BMl5HI8Rku+KejUqTvdWOX6nQjSpepXwGuN/jJ
```

This is AES-256-CBC encrypted, base64 encoded, with salt (indicated by `Salted__` prefix when decoded).

## Password Attempts

The following password patterns have been tested without success:

### Matrix-Related
- `theproblemischoice`
- `yourgreatestweakness`
- `hope`, `humphhope`
- `quintessentialhumandelusion`
- `denial`
- `anomaly`, `theone`
- Various Architect quotes

### Puzzle-Related
- `matrixsumlist`, `enter`, `matrixsumlistenter`
- `theseedisplanted`
- `causality`
- Previous phase passwords

### Numeric
- Matrix sum values (422, 100110001001, 2441)
- Various binary/hex conversions

### Other
- Bitcoin-related terms
- Logic (The Warning song)
- Chess-related terms

## Key Observations

1. **"lastwordsbeforearchichoice"** - The password appears to be the Architect's last words before presenting the choice in Matrix Reloaded. However, standard interpretations haven't worked.

2. **"archi"** might not refer to "Architect":
   - Could be a name
   - Could be "architecture"
   - Could be an abbreviation for something else

3. **Matrix sum hint** - "matrixsumlist" suggests calculating some sum from the SalPhaselon letter grid. The grid uses letters a-i representing 1-9.

4. **First hint = last command** - The phrase suggests the solution involves using an early puzzle element as the final key.

## Cosmic Duality Section

A separate AES blob exists in the Cosmic Duality section below SalPhaselon. This may require solving SalPhaselon first, or could be an alternative path.

## Recommendations for Future Solvers

1. **Research the exact Architect dialogue** - The specific wording matters
2. **Explore alternative meanings of "archi"** - May not be "Architect"
3. **Calculate matrix sums** - Try different sum operations on the letter grid
4. **Visit Decentraland** - The coordinates `-41, -17` may have additional clues
5. **Check for steganography** - Images may contain hidden data
6. **Consider multi-step passwords** - May need to combine multiple elements

## Comprehensive Password Testing (November 2025)

### Passwords Tested (500+ combinations)

#### Matrix Theme
- All major dialogue quotes from The Matrix trilogy
- Architect's exact final words: "she is going to die and there is nothing that you can do to stop it"
- Red pill/blue pill scene quotes from Morpheus
- "theproblemischoice", "hope", "denial", "causality", etc.

#### Decoded Elements as Passwords
- `matrixsumlist` (raw and SHA256)
- `enter` (raw and SHA256)
- `lastwordsbeforearchichoice` (raw and SHA256)
- `thispassword` (raw and SHA256)
- All permutations and combinations of the above

#### Matrix Sum Values
- Row sums: 57, 75, 74, 57, 63, 71, 25
- Total sum: 422
- Binary: 100110001001
- Various formats: comma-separated, space-separated, concatenated

#### Previous Phase Passwords
- All passwords from phases 1-3.2.1
- SHA256 hashes used in previous phases
- Concatenations of multi-part keys

#### "First Hint" Interpretations
- `theseedisplanted` (first decoded URL)
- `gsmg.io/theseedisplanted` (full first hint)
- `matrixsumlist` (first decode in SalPhaselon)
- Various SHA256 hashes of these

#### Alternative "Archi" Meanings
- Archimedes-related: "eureka", "donnotdisturbmycircles"
- Archbishop, Architecture, Archetype
- Greek "archē" (first/primary)

#### Technical Variations
- Different OpenSSL digest modes: -md md5, sha256, sha512, sha1
- PBKDF2 with various iteration counts
- XOR combinations of decoded elements
- Different case patterns (uppercase, lowercase, mixed)

### Key Insight: Clue Structure

The hint "sha b e f our first hint is your last command" should be parsed as:
- `sha b e f` = SHA256 (where b=2, e=5, f=6 in the puzzle's encoding)
- `our first hint` = either "theseedisplanted" (puzzle's first URL) or "matrixsumlist" (SalPhaselon's first decode)
- `is your last command` = use this as the final password

Despite this clear instruction, SHA256 of these values does not decrypt the AES blob.

### Possible Explanations

1. **Multi-layer encryption**: The decrypted text from Phase 3.2.1 mentions "SIXTEEN ENCRYPTIONS AND OR SEVEN INTERTWINED PASSWORDS"
2. **Missing information**: There may be clues in Decentraland (coordinates -41, -17) or other locations
3. **Non-standard encoding**: The password might use special characters or encoding not yet tried
4. **Deliberate obfuscation**: The puzzle creator may have included misleading clues

## Next Steps for Future Solvers

1. **Visit Decentraland**: Go to coordinates -41, -17 for potential audio clues
2. **Analyze audio spectrogram**: The hint "HASHTHETEXT" was found via audio analysis
3. **Check for steganography**: Images may contain hidden data requiring specialized tools
4. **Community collaboration**: Check Bitcoin forums and puzzle communities for new insights
5. **Blockchain analysis**: Study transaction patterns for possible clues

## NEW FINDINGS FROM ONLINE RESEARCH (November 2025)

### GitHub Issue #56 - Seven Token Password Theory

A detailed analysis in [GitHub Issue #56](https://github.com/puzzlehunt/gsmgio-5btc-puzzle/issues/56) proposes a **seven-token password sequence** for the Cosmic Duality phase:

1. `matrixsumlist`
2. `enter`
3. `lastwordsbeforearchichoice`
4. `thispassword`
5. `matrixsumlist` (repeated)
6. `yourlastcommand`
7. `secondanswer`

**Decryption Process (Proposed):**
- SHA-256 hash each token (32 bytes each)
- XOR all hashes sequentially to produce a final 32-byte key
- Use as EVP_BytesToKey input with salt for AES-256-CBC decryption
- Result: 1327-byte binary containing Matrix-themed narrative

### "Half and Better Half" Discovery

The decrypted message states: *"IN CASE YOU MANAGE TO CRACK THIS THE PRIVATE KEYS BELONG TO HALF AND BETTER HALF AND THEY ALSO NEED FUNDS TO LIVE."*

**Implication:** The final phase may require:
- Finding two Bitcoin addresses hidden in the puzzle
- Funding these addresses to "activate" the final solution
- Current status: Both revealed addresses show 0 balance

### Architect's Exact Last Words Before Neo's Choice

From [The Architect Transcript](https://scottmanning.com/content/the-architect-transcript/):

> "An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple, and obvious truth: **she is going to die, and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.**"

This is the Architect's final statement before Neo walks to the left door. Possible password interpretations:
- `sheisgoingtodieandthereisnothingthatyoucandotostopit`
- `theproblemischoice`
- Various condensed forms

### Decentraland Clue (Coordinates -41, -17)

The [GSMG.io Puzzle Piece on Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/places/place/?position=-41.-17) contains:
- An audio file with steganographic content
- **Solution method**: Split stereo track → invert one channel → mix back → mix to mono → create spectrogram
- **Hidden message**: `HASHTHETEXT`
- The NFT description mentions "White Rabbits everywhere"

### GitHub Issue #15 - Solution Claims

User Hilltopperjm claimed to have a solution (July 2023). Community observations:
- SalPhaselon may be required to get the Cosmic Duality key
- "dbbi/faedg" was discussed as a partially solved element
- 127+ comments with various collaboration attempts
- No explicit solution was publicly shared

### Alternative Interpretations of "archi"

The term "archi" in `lastwordsbeforearchichoice` may refer to:
1. **Architect** (Matrix) - Most common interpretation
2. **Archimedes** - Famous quote: "Give me a lever long enough and I shall move the world" or "Eureka!"
3. **Archi** - Could be a name or abbreviation
4. **Greek "archē"** - Meaning "first principle" or "origin"

### New Password Candidates to Test

Based on online research:
```
